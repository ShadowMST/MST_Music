This is a Music Bot which you can implement the code into your own Bot


I have also added the Feature to the Bot which includes:
!join       - to join the voice channel the author is present in!
!play       - to play the song with the url provided!
!pause      - to pause the song being played!
!resume     - to resume the paused song!
!disconnect - to disconnect the bot from the voice channel!









PS: I have made this bot on replit: https://replit.com/@ShadowMaster7?username=ShadowMaster7
And since Replit dosen't support FFMPEG anymore I have used the Following Workaround where all I did was go to the project, then go to packages and search for ffmpeg then install it. After that, go to Files, click the three dot button and show hidden files. You'll see replit.nix file, open it and you'll see a list named deps. Add pkgs.ffmpeg to that list and the bot will work!
